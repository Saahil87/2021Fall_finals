# Life beyond Earth

### Overview:
Life beyond the Earth has always been a fascinating quest for scientists. Roughly 1.2% out of an approximate 5000 exoplanets have been found to be in the “habitable zone [1]” in our observed universe, yet there exists a question on whether these planets could actually host life. At the same time, there are organisms on earth – the extremophiles, that can survive under extreme conditions these exoplanets [2] have to offer. Our study analyzes these planets and examines the survival rate of extremophiles [3] on these planets.

Here are the hypotheses we found fit to explore extremophiles on exoplanets:

### Hypothesis 1: All exoplanets that fall in the habitable zone of their solar system posses earth-like conditions and vice-versa.

### Hypothesis 2: If any of the exoplanets possesses similar conditions in which an Extremophile can survive, then those planets could potentially host life.

[1] Habitable Zone - the orbital region around a star in which an Earth-like planet can possess liquid water on its surface and possibly support life.

[2] Exoplanets - Planets that orbit around other stars are called exoplanets.

[3] Extremophiles - a microorganism, that lives in conditions of extreme temperature, acidity, alkalinity, or chemical concentration.
